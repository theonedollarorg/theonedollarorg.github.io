         <p class="w3-text-black">We, a group of friends, realised over a dinner conversation that all of us want to contribute in some way or the other to help make the world a better place. But each one of us on that table wanted to support a different cause. Also, the donations each one of us would make were like a teeny tiny drop in the ocean. That's when The One Dollar Org was thought of...each one of sets aside a small amount each month, we pool it together to form a substantial amount and donate it to a different cause each month. After doing this for a couple of months we decided to reach a larger audience to get the support we need.
         <br><br>
          We are just a bunch of youngsters who want to do some good. While all of us cannot physically participate, we can certainly help those doing the actual ground work. Come join us to give a helping hand to those who need it!
         <br><br>
         Being a part of us is easy and simple!</p><br>
